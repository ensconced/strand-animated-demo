## Strand Construction Demo

#### To check it out:

```
git clone https://github.com/ensconced/strand-animated-demo
cd ./strand-animated-demo
npm install
npm start
```

#### Reviewing the code

- start at `/src/scripts/main.js`
- most of the interesting stuff is happening in `/src/scripts/strand.js`

#### Background info

This demo limits itself to one stage of the knot-drawing algorithm, namely the stage which produces an array of points through which the constructed strand will pass. This array of points is constructed on the basis of a 'frame', which is just a collection of points and a set of lines connecting those points.

For the purposes of this demonstration, we will focus on this knot:

This is a simple example where the knot consists of one strand only.

This is constructed on the basis of this frame:

As we traverse our way around the frame, we alternate between taking "left turns", and "right turns". An analogy would be that you're driving a car (the blue arrow), and your keep reaching roundabouts (the purple nodes). You alternate between taking the "first exit" or "left turn" and the "last exit" or "right turn". (These are UK roundabouts).

> N.B. In some cases, there will only be two possible exits from a "roundabout", including the line from which you are entering the roundabout. In such cases, a right turn and left turn are equivalent.

At each step, the "crossing point" (i.e. the point at the centre of the blue line) is added to an array representing the growing strand. At each step, we also have to check whether we need to add a "pointed return" (i.e. one of the fancy pointy corners). This is determined based on a comparison of the angles of the current line and the next line that will be visited as we traverse the frame.

#### **Not** covered by this demo:

- user interaction
- smoothing of curves between the strand points
- offsetting of strands into two parallel lines
- line-trimming to produce over/under pattern
